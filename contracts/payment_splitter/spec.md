This contract allows to split ETH payments among a group of users. The split can be in equal parts or in any other arbitrary proportion. The way this is specified is by assigning each account to a number of shares.

At deployment, the contract creator specifies the set of users who will receive the payments and the corresponding number of shares. The set of shareholders and their shares cannot be updated thereafter.

After creation, the contract supports the following actions:
- `receive`, which allows anyone to deposit ETH in the contract;
- `release`, which allows anyone to distribute the contract balance to the shareholders. Each shareholder will receive an amount proportional to the percentage of total shares they were assigned. 

The contract follows a pull payment model. This means that payments are not automatically forwarded to the accounts but kept in this contract, and the actual transfer is triggered as a separate step by calling the `release()` function.
