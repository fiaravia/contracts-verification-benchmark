# PriceBet

## Specification
The PriceBet contract allows a single player to place a bet against the contract owner. The bet is based on a future exchange rate between two tokens. 

To create the contract, the owner specifies:
- itself as the contract owner;
- the initial pot, which is transferred from the owner to the contract;
- an oracle, i.e a contract that is queried for the exchange rate between two given tokens;
- a deadline, i.e. a time limit after which the player loses the bet;
- a target exchange rate, which must be reached in order for the player to win the bet.

The contract has the following entry points:
- **join()**, which allows a player to join the bet. This requires the player to deposit an amount of native cryptocurrency equal to the initial pot;
- **win()**, which allows the joined player to withdraw the whole contract balance if the oracle exchange rate is greater than the bet rate. The player can call win() multiple times before the deadline. This action is disabled after the deadline;
- **timeout()**, which can be called by anyone after the deadline, and transfers the whole contract balance to the owner


## Properties
- **eventually-balance-zero**: eventually (i.e. at least once after the initial state) the contract balance goes to zero (assuming the fairness condition that `timeout()` is called at least once at a suitable time after the deadline).
- **eventually-balance-zero-receive**: if the receive method of `owner` just accepts all ETH, eventually (i.e. at least once after the initial state) the contract balance goes to zero (assuming the fairness condition that `timeout()` is called at least once after the deadline).
- **eventually-withdraw**: if the player has joined, eventually (i.e. at least once after the initial state) a user can fire a transaction to withdraw at least twice the initial pot.
- **eventually-withdraw-receive-owner**: if the `receive` method of `owner` just accepts all ETH, and the player has joined, eventually (i.e. at least once after the initial state) a user can fire a transaction to withdraw at least twice the initial pot.
- **eventually-withdraw-receive-player**: if the `receive` method of `player` just accepts all ETH, and the player has joined, eventually (i.e. at least once after the initial state) a user can fire a transaction to withdraw at least twice the initial pot.
- **join-balance-eq**: after a non-reverting `join()`, the contract balance is equal to two times the `initial_pot`.
- **join-balance-geq**: after a non-reverting `join()`, the contract balance is greater than or equal to two times the `initial_pot`.
- **join-not-revert**: a transaction `join()` does not revert if the ETH amount sent along with the transaction is equal to `initial_pot`, no player has joined yet, and the deadline has not passed yet.
- **join-only-once**: a non-reverting `join()` transaction can only be fired once.
- **join-player**: after a non-reverting `join()`, `player` is not the zero address
- **join-revert**: a transaction `join()` reverts if the amount of ETH sent along with the transaction is different from `initial_pot`, or the `player` has already been set to a non-zero address, or the deadline has passed.
- **only-owner-or-player-receive**: in any state where the player has been set, only the owner or the player can receive ETH from the contract.
- **owner-cannot-receive-before-deadline**: if the deadline has not passed yet, then the `owner` cannot receive ETH from the PriceBet contract.
- **owner-cannot-receive-before-deadline-not-player**: if the deadline has not passed yet and the `owner` is not the `player`, then the `owner` cannot receive ETH from the PriceBet contract.
- **owner-cannot-withdraw-before-deadline**: if the deadline has not passed yet, then the `owner` cannot fire a transaction (to the PriceBet contract) after which its ETH balance is increased.
- **owner-cannot-withdraw-before-deadline-not-player**: if the deadline has not passed yet and the `owner` is not the `player`, then the `owner` cannot fire a transaction (to the PriceBet contract) after which its ETH balance is increased.
- **player-cannot-withdraw-after-deadline**: if the deadline has passed, the `player` cannot withdraw any ETH.
- **player-cannot-withdraw-after-deadline-not-owner**: if the deadline has passed, and the `player` is not the `owner`, then the `player` cannot withdraw any ETH.
- **player-immutable**: if `player` is not the zero address, then its value does never change
- **price-above-player-win**: if `player` is an EOA, and it has not already fired a non-reverting `win`, then in a state where the value returned by calling `get_exchange_rate()` on the oracle is above the target `exchange_rate` and the deadline has not passed, the `player` can fire a transaction after which its ETH balance is increased by the contract balance.
- **price-above-player-win-frontrun**: if `player` is an EOA and it has not already fired a non-reverting `win`, and in some state before the deadline the value returned by a call `get_exchange_rate()` on the oracle goes above the target `exchange_rate`, then in any subsequent state before the deadline the `player` can fire a transaction after which its ETH balance is increased by the contract balance.
- **price-below-player-lose**: if the oracle exchange rate is always below the target `exchange_rate` before the deadline, then `player` cannot (neither before nor after the deadline) fire a transaction after which its ETH balance is increased.
- **price-below-player-lose-before-deadline-not-owner**: if the oracle exchange rate is below the target `exchange_rate` and the `player` is not the `owner`, then before the deadline the `player` cannot fire a transaction after which its ETH balance is increased.
- **price-below-player-lose-not-owner**: if the oracle exchange rate is always below the target `exchange_rate` before the deadline, and the `player` is not the `owner`, then `player` cannot (neither before nor after the deadline) fire a transaction after which its ETH balance is increased.
- **timeout-balance**: after a non-reverting `timeout()`, the ETH balance of `owner` is increased by the entire contract balance.
- **timeout-balance-receive**: if the `receive` method of `owner` just accepts all ETH, after a non-reverting `timeout()`, the ETH balance of `owner` is increased by the entire contract balance.
- **timeout-not-revert**: a transaction `timeout()` does not revert if the deadline has passed.
- **timeout-not-revert-receive**: if the `receive` method of `owner` just accepts all ETH, a transaction `timeout()` does not revert if the deadline has passed.
- **timeout-revert**: a transaction `timeout()` reverts if the deadline has not passed yet.
- **transfer-pot**: if some user manages to withdraw ETH from the contract, then the amount withdrawn by that user is at least twice the initial pot.
- **transfer-pot-join**: if some user has joined the bet (i.e. `player` is not the zero address) and some user manages to withdraw ETH from the contract, then the amount withdrawn by that user is at least twice the initial pot.
- **tx-assets-transfer-any**: eventually (i.e. at least once after the initial state), there exists some user who can perform some transaction after which the entire contract balance is trasferred to its own address.
- **tx-assets-transfer-owner**: eventually (i.e. at least once after the initial state), there exists some user who can perform some transaction after which the entire contract balance is trasferred to the `owner`.
- **win-balance**: after a non-reverting `win()`, the ETH balance of `player` is increased by the entire contract balance.
- **win-balance-receive**: if the `receive` method of `player` just accepts all ETH, then after a non-reverting `win()`, the ETH balance of `player` is increased by the entire contract balance.
- **win-frontrun**: if the `player` can win the bet, there exists an adversary that can frontrun the `player` to prevent him from actually winning.
- **win-frontrun-not-oracle**: if the `player` can win the bet, there exists an adversary different from the oracle owner who can frontrun the `player` to prevent him from actually winning.
- **win-not-revert**: a transaction `win()` does not revert if the deadline has not expired, the sender is the `player`, and the call to oracle returns an exchange rate that is greater than or equal to the target `exchange_rate`.
- **win-pot**: after a non-reverting `win()`, the ETH balance of `player` is increased at least twice the initial pot.
- **win-pot-receive**: if the `receive` method of `player` just accepts all ETH, then after a non-reverting `win()`, the ETH balance of `player` increases of at least twice the initial pot.
- **win-revert**: a transaction `win()` reverts if the deadline has expired, or the sender is not the player, or the `exchange_rate` within the Oracle contract is less than the target `exchange_rate` within the PriceBet contract. Assume that the address `oracle` actually contains a deployment of contract Oracle.

## Versions
- **v1**: minimal implementation conforming to specifications
- **v2**: `join` does not check if player has already joined 
- **v3**: `timeout()` callable only before the deadline ('<' instead of '>=')
- **v4**: `join()` does not require the player to deposit an amount corresponding to the initial pot
- **v5**: `join()` requires the player to transfer an amount strictly greater than the initial pot
- **v6**: `join()` forgets to update the `player` field  
- **v7**: `win()` can be called also after the deadline  
- **v8**: `win()` only transfers 1 instead of the entire contract balance  
- **v9**: `win()` does not check if the oracle exchange rate is greater than the target exchange rate
- **v10**: `join` can be called after the deadline
- **v11**: after a second deadline, anyone can withdraw the entire contract balance
- **v12**: `join` checks that player is different from owner
- **v13**: `win` uses `block.timestamp` instead of `block.number`
- **v14**: uses `transfer` instead of low-level `call` to send ETH
- **v15**: `timeout` can only be called once, if a player has joined, and resets player
- **v16**: `join` and `win` use (broken) balance invariants as guards for state transitions
